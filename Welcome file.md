CS50 Final Project README**

# CS50 Scheduler

My project, titled ***CS50 Scheduler***, is a simple hub where you can keep track of homework from courses, keep a todo list, and have a notepad in which you can save ideas.

I borrowed ideas and work from *CS50 Finance* such as the *Register*, *Login* and *Change Password* functions to complete my project. On the *Register* page, I kept the function I built in where the username field checks immediately if the username is taken before the form is submitted.

## /index (Main Page)

Contains an View of Courses, Homework, and contains the To-Do List and Notepad. Features include Tables with Bootstrap Popovers to reveal more information (and to delete homework).

## /homework
Allows you to view, add new, and delete homework all within a Bootstrap Table.

Making this section allowed me to start playing with Bootstrap Tables and working with 3rd party widgets such as Tempus Dominus's DateTimePickers.

## /courses
Allows you to view, add new, edit, and delete courses to your account. All data is viewed in a Bootstrap Table. Adding, Editing, and Deleting data are all done within Bootstrap Modals.

Making this section allowed me to start playing with Bootstrap Modals.

## Other Info
The data from the different forms submitted are stored in an SQL database.

This project definitely helped me to improve my Python, HTML, database, JavaScript and jQuery skills. 

**THIS WAS CS50!**
